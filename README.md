How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs in order to implement them into a program requires a working relationship with the users of the program. Often, a needs analysis is compeleted and the Product Owner will often reach out to users in order to see what their requirements are.  Creating user stories helps to capture the needs of the users in small, workable pieces.  The user stories help to guide the development and testing of the software, and also serve as a living document that reflects the history of the software.  The user stories are prioritized by the Product Owner so that they are worked by the Scrum team in a manner that provides the most value to the project.


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Developing programs is based off the needs of the users. Oftentimes, development is approached as a way to help solve a business problem. As a developer, it is alway helpful to see the problem that a user is having and trying to find a way to help the business fix it in order for the user to get their work done.  Agile processes that I hope to incorporate in the future are paired programming, a focus on more user interaction, and a proper definition of what is expected of the role of Scrum Master.  I also hope to see an adoption of Agile that is Scaled and the various resources involved be committed to seeing it exceed without falling back into old 'Waterfall' mentalities and practices. 


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member has a respect for the business user and is dedicated to seeing them get their work done.  A good team member is respectful of the others on the team and has a natural tendency to want to solve problems and create solutions to enable a business to succeed.  A good team member will support the others and help out as much as they can when someone may be stuck by contributing their knowledge and skill set to the team.  I feel that a good team member also embraces change and is excited about working with technology in order to keep their own skill sets relevant and is a highly self-motivated person.
